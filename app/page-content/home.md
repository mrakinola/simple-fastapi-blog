# Simple FastAPI Website Home

Hello my name is Ebenezer and welcome to my project in creating a simple website which uses FastAPI in the backend, whilst using html and css in the frontend. Other helper libraries were used throughout the project and can be seen in the requirements.txt

## Page layouts

There are a number of pages here, with some just displayed to showcase the design. The navigation bar is a key example of this as some pages are there to illustrate the drop down menus.
