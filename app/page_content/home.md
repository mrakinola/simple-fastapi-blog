# Simple FastAPI Website Home

Hello my name is EbenezerðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my project in creating a simple website.
FastAPI

 is used in the backend, whilst HTML

 and CSS
<img src="/static/images/css-logo.png" width="40" height="40">
 are used in the frontend. Other helper libraries were used
 throughout the project and can be seen in the requirements file

## Page layouts

There are a number of pages here,
with some just displayed to showcase the design.
The navigation bar is a key example of this as some pages
are there to illustrate the drop down menus.
