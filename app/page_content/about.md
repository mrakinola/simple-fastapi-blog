# About

## So what is the project about?

Just an example of how a simple website can be made quite easily with the help of FastAPI, Jinja2 and some basic HTML and CSS knowledge. This is more for me to take this as stepping stone to go and do more projects in the future.

## Future Works?

In the near future, further backend implementation will be done to make the website function more like a blog (dockerizing files, adding a database, detailed error exception handling + more)
